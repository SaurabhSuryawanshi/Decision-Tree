Overview

-This repository contains a project focused on using Decision Trees for the analysis and classification of kidney disease.
-The aim is to leverage machine learning techniques to gain insights from the dataset and predict kidney disease outcomes effectively

Dataset

-The project uses the Kidney Disease Dataset, which includes information about patient health indicators.
-The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and ensure compatibility with the Decision Tree algorithm.
-Key features in the dataset include:
- Age, Blood Pressure, Specific Gravity, Albumin, Sugar
- Hemoglobin, Packed Cell Volume, White Blood Cell Count
- Serum Creatinine, Sodium, Potassium, and more

Objectives

- Explore the dataset and visualize key insights.
- Build a Decision Tree model to predict the presence or absence of kidney disease.
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Dependencies:-

-Python 3.x
-Pandas
-Scikit-learn
-Matplotlib
-Seaborn
-Numpy
-Jupyter Notebook (optional)
